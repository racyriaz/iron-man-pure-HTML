        <div>
            Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, hero and former playboy who is CEO of Stark Industries. At the
            beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, until he has a change of
            heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of mechanized suits of armor which he uses to
            defend against those that would threaten peace around the world.

        <h4>About the Actor</h4>
        <div>Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor and producer. His career has been
            characterized by critical and popular success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and
            legal troubles, before a resurgence of commercial success in middle age. In 2008, Downey was named by Time
            magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by
            Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid actor. His films have grossed over $14.4 billion worldwide, making
            Downey the sixth-highest-grossing box office star of all-time.5]</div>
